I have actually been a developer and led teams of developers over the past 25 years. Due to time and resource constraints, I decided to use meet2amit to help us build a completely new frontend for our web project using the latest web technologies. Being a developer, I could could see that meet2amit easily and fully understood what we needed just by looking at some poorly created drawings and prototypes. Not only did he understand the frontend needs, he was able to easily grasp the functional needs and overall how the system should work. Not only was he able to complete the project sooner and cleaner than expected, but his expertise allowed him to give amazing suggestions and ideas on how to implement some facets of the system that transformed some parts from a historically terrible and difficult experience to a streamlined and easy to use interface. Being a past and current developer and having even developed some of the technologies that he was using, and knowing what questions and terms to ask in order to evaluate a potential developer, he clearly showed his technical expertise with these technologies, which allowed him to quickly and easily assimilate our legacy system in a fraction of the time that we planned. We would bring him on for future projects without hesitation
