## NFT ##

I have just read your project description I have done free open-source NFT projects based on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Tezos blockchain ecosystems.
I should state that I have in-depth experience in other aspects of blockchain programming, particularly in NFT smart contracts and marketplaces.
For instance, I have been developing NDA-based projects for my clients based on the following technologies :

- Designing fractionalized NFT tokens (multi-ownership, governance, voting,etc)
- Rust for Solana and Solidity for Ethereum { Smart contract}
- IPFS { for the NFT storage, ipfsarweave, AWS }
- Anchor { framework }
- ERC-721, ERC-20, ERC-1155
- Tezos, Algorand, and Solana
- OpenSea
- Graphql (querying)

In order to design NFT marketplaces and generally NFT projects, I use Solidity, Rust, Polygon, Cardano, Tezos, or Algorand for designing the
NFT token itself. Moreover, in order to design the web applications and their features such as minting, auctions,... I use React, HTML, CSS, Laravel.

In addition to the aforementioned stacks of technology, I am also fully aware of blockchain-associated concepts, such as the pros and cons of various blockchain architectures, designing ERC20/721/1155 tokens, Binance Smart Chain, trusted execution environment (TEE), the MEV inspection, and performing security audit and exploitation of various blockchain codes.
I often use the Openzeppelin library in terms of smart contract tokens, which results in more secure tokens.
Moreover, I have been working as a full-stack web developer for several companies such as Djs for a few years. I have developed many commercial web applications via React and Node.js for different individual startups. Thus, I can contribute to your project in both programmings.

In terms of WEB3.JS I am quite experienced with the following technologies and have several online proofs:

Web3.js
Infura
Ganache
Ethers.JS
Brownie

Apart from designing a high-quality blockchain DApp, safety and security would be the next critical point in my designs. Because smart contracts are immutable, that means developers CANNOT fix any bugs/vulnerabilities after releasing the smart contract on a target blockchain.

Accordingly, introducing a reliable and successful smart contract project requires sufficient programming knowledge and extensive knowledge and experience of security audit/fuzzing and understanding various security threats in this emerging ecosystem. In this regard, I always perform the following security vulnerabilities testing during my blockchain developments:

Integer Overflow and Underflow
Reentrancy
Timestamp Dependence
Block Gas Limit Bug
Front-running

https://securecontract.io
In terms of code documentation, smart contract documentation is a critical part of a blockchain development lifecycle. It must be carried out in order to create a full-fledged and highly reputable piece of code. Note that in the absence of proper code documentation,

For my smart-contract projects, I often use solidity-docgen, which introduces one of the best forms for smart contract documentation, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec).

Warm Regards.

## question ##
1.Include a link to your GitHub profile and/or website


what to test
.The appearance of the component
.The different branches that render
.That functions get called as expected

Use the testing tools - jest,Mocha,Chai,Jasmine,Enzyme

portfolio - https://bo-development.com/home
	
I generally do manual testing
I also have knowledge of jest for testing purposes.
