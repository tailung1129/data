Greetings!
Thank you for this job opportunity.

We are a team of professional developers and designers with already more than 11 years of industry experience and ready to help you greatly with any work needed for this project.

As an NFT example from our portfolio I would also like to demonstrate ZestBloom which is a next generation Digital Media marketplace seeking to offer a brand new way of experiencing Crypto Art while simultaneously supporting and promoting artists for their contributions. It is built on Algorand (https://www.algorand.com/nft), one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains to date allowing to facilitate purchases and track ownership of assets, with significantly reduced fees and smaller carbon footprint. Please check the link to the website below:
https://zestbloom.com/

Another project I would like to demonstrate is Insight Prediction which is a betting platform for different events (markets). Users get wallets for different crypto coins (USDC, BTC, ETH) to deposit money into the system, place bids for different events and convert between different crypto coins to withdraw the money from their account.
1. Perform complex calculations for share creation, as well as the resolved markets.
2. Show statistics on the profits, ROI, and the harmonic average based on the ranking.
3. While migrating markets from other platforms, convert into the respective format to be able to import into our platform.
4. Ensure a total synchronization of the platforms so that the market is updated immediately in our platform whenever it gets updated in the original platform. We have used WebSocket to ensure this synchronization. Please check the link below:
https://insightprediction.com/

So, let me suggest you to schedule a date and meet online to discuss our candidacy and some more project details as well, what do you think?

Looking forward to working with you in the nearest future.

Best regards,
