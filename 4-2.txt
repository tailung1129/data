good day, thank you for your inquiry.
the platform should be similar to linkedin.
if you're familiar with it, we'd love to talk about it

Nazar M Koli 11:12 AM
Thanks for your reply. How about your weekends?
I am familiar with this and I love it. Can you discuss further?

FK
Florian Keeven 11:18 AM
OK,
you know the platform
the design should look like this. since it's in angular, you have to copy it. there is also a react version, but it doesn't resemble angular and its functions. so the design has to be recreated.
click on the link, go to the red gear on the right and choose layout "Dense"
that's how it should look

Nazar M Koli 11:32 AM
Ok, very nice. I am very familiar with Fuse theme and have much knowledge in Fuse react. It is a large and popular theme and I am capable of your idea. So you mean you want to rebuild the website based on react that looks like "Dense" mode, right?

FK
Florian Keeven 11:34 AM
yes, but as already mentioned, please don't use the react template, because it doesn't look like angular.
it really needs to be rebuilt. the template must look like the angular demo.

this is just the first phase.
when this is finished, other work will be added.
But I don't want to discuss that until the first phase is completed.
when everything works according to my ideas and I am enthusiastic. we will start a long work together.
which can last up to two years

Please give me time, I have to do something quickly.
will be back online in 1 hour maybe 2 hours.
please consider whether everything is feasible on your part.

Nazar M Koli 11:48 AM
sure

Nazar M Koli 3:15 PM
Hi, come back again, Florian?

let me leave my message.

I see what you want. I have just seen the react-version(http://react-material.fusetheme.com/pages/profile), too. It seems to be very similar to angular version, but it is a bit different that you have mentioned.

Hello, I'm online.
what can you suggest me
how long does it take you to work?
tell me your suggestions

Nazar M Koli 3:19 PM
Ok sure.

FK
Florian Keeven 3:20 PM
exactly, that's why you have to contact the demo angular and rebuild it.

Nazar M Koli 3:20 PM
During you are away, I have analyzed the angular theme to copy it to react-version sufficiently, so I think no problem to implement your idea. In both angular and react project, it contains 'node_modules', as you know. So what I have to do is that I will convert the angular component to the react component. In there, I will need to change the internal variables in angular to react-redux idea. Due to using Virtual DOM (in react-redux's advantage), in react the speed improved more than angular. I believe you understand me. This is my plan that you give me the project. No problem.

So I wanna know which website I will copy it to react-version?

http://angular-material.fusetheme.com/dashboards/project, right?

Fuse Angular - Angular Template and Starter Kit
Admin Template and Starter Kit with Angular, Angular Material Components and TailwindCSS
or what?

FK
Florian Keeven 3:23 PM
I don't understand this question now

Nazar M Koli 3:27 PM
Sorry, Please explain further what you pointed.

FK
Florian Keeven 3:28 PM
I hope I answered specifically.
i need a new community
admin and user that is newly created.
community of logistics is the topic
with the functions of linkedin. as in the description.

the design (template) should look like this
http://angular-material.fusetheme.com/pages/profile
red gear and click on layout "Dense"
menu on the right, mouseover effect, chat on the left, and main page.

Florian Keeven 3:41 PM
didn't you read the description?

Nazar M Koli 3:42 PM
Of course read.

But for your project, I need any sketches or mockup. Got it? I hope you understand me

And there are only functions for social project, not how many pages. I think we need to clear before starting sufficiently

FK
Florian Keeven 3:46 PM
maybe we're talking about something else
ok i will explain again briefly.

the platform and its functions are like linkedin.
but only for logistics and manufacturers.

do you know the functions of linkedin?

Nazar M Koli 3:51 PM
Sure, I will make the project exactly looks like linkedin, but it is different in logistics and manufacturers right?

FK
Florian Keeven 4:02 PM

Nazar M Koli 4:02 PM

sorry I cant get you

Please let's discuss detail.

FK
Florian Keeven 4:04 PM
the second, function like linkedin but with the design "Dense"

Nazar M Koli 4:05 PM
Okay, so you mean you dont have any sketch or mockup. All right.

FK
Florian Keeven 4:06 PM

No I have not

Nazar M Koli 4:07 PM
No, no document.

I mean design.

FK
Florian Keeven 4:08 PM
sketch or mockup ?

no

Nazar M Koli 4:08 PM
sure

FK
Florian Keeven 4:09 PM
no, I don't have a design either.
That's why I show you the link from the template

Nazar M Koli 4:10 PM
Oh, I see your quick hesitation. I got it.

But I really need rough design at least. You can draw in your paper and take a photo and give me it.
And I will provide you the project like your design. It is possible for you?

FK
Florian Keeven 4:16 PM
hier did you see that?
this is the design

Nazar M Koli 4:21 PM
Oh, really sorry. I have mistakes. very clear

one more question remain. Which framework it will need for backend. I am capable of nodejs laravel,php and so on.
I recommend you Node js. Because I really love MERN-stack as i mentioned before in proposal.

FK
Florian Keeven 4:27 PM
yes node.js

Nazar M Koli 4:27 PM
Node js is very pupular because it is non-blocking and implement async as you know

ok

Nazar M Koli 4:32 PM
I really hope to go together and it will be our first collaboration. I wish my expertise will accelerate your business. 🙂

And then, to communicate with you, how aobut s-k-y-p-e or tel--e-g-r-a-m? My s-k-y id: live:.cid.c9a2cd0426635a28
